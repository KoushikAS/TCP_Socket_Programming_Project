# TCP Socket Programming Project
## ECE 650 â€“ Spring 2023

### Overview
This project implements a multiplayer game of hot potato using TCP socket programming, Developed as part of ECE-650 Systems Program & Engineering, this individual project. The game consists of a ringmaster process and multiple player processes communicating in a ring topology. The goal is to pass a "potato" object among players until a randomly determined endpoint, at which the game concludes, and the player holding the potato is marked as "it".

### Features
- **Ringmaster Process:** Initiates the game, sends the potato to a random player, and concludes the game.
- **Player Processes:** Form a ring network where each player passes the potato to either neighbor.
- **TCP Sockets:** Used for communication between the ringmaster and players, and among players themselves.
- **Dynamic Player Interaction:** Players listen to multiple channels and make decisions based on game rules.
- **Game Trace Output:** Ringmaster prints a trace of the game showing the path of the potato.

### How to Run
1. **Ringmaster Program:** 
   ```bash
   ./ringmaster <port_num> <num_players> <num_hops>
   ```
   - Example: ./ringmaster 1234 3 100

2. **Player Program:** 
   ```bash
   ./player <machine_name> <port_num>
   ```
   - Example: ./player vcm-xxxx.vm.duke.edu 1234
   - machine_name is where the ringmaster process is running.

### Responsibilities
- **Ringmaster:**
  - Establishes socket connections with players.
  - Initiates and ends the game, reporting results.

- **Players:**
  - Establish socket connections for communication.
  - Continuously listen to channels for the potato or commands.
  - Handle game logic based on the number of hops remaining.

### Communication Mechanism
- TCP sockets facilitate communication between processes.
- Players are assigned IDs to track the potato's path.
- Ringmaster sends essential game information to each player.

### Output Specifications
- **Ringmaster's Output:**
  - Initial game setup details.
  - Connection acknowledgments from players.
  - Game start announcement and potato's path trace.

- **Player's Output:**
  - Confirmation of connection and player ID.
  - Notifications of sending the potato.
  - Announcement of being "it" if holding the potato at game end.
